# Reliable Systems through Platform Engineering

## Abstract

Infrastructure breaks, but systems can persist! We really want systems that withstand unavoidable failures. Abstractly, we understand that. In this talk, Steve presents concepts like spanning failure domains and using generic mitigations through Platform Engineering, as well as introducing a lab environment where teams can experiment with these capabilities directly and a community where we can discuss it all, memes and all.
